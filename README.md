## Hi there 👋
My name is Theo, and I'm a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics major at Indiana University! Along with learning everything I can about Math and Computers I have a strong passion for science communication and education.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Pyrdle: A python remake of Wordle where the hints are trivia facts about planes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for general programming and C and C++ for competitive programming.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with data structures and algorithms

Here are some of the things I am currently working on: 
  - Introduction to CS Using Python (Notes and Problem Sets)
  - Project Euler Archived Problems
  - LeetCode Problems
    

I want to use my Github as an environment for my future students to show them how much work goes into being a good programmer and mathematician. Along with projects, I've decided to post all of the notes of self/university study that I've done. Every repo's README will contain stats with the amount of work I've done to complete them.
